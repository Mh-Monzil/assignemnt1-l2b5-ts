# Difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript

## any

### What it means:

It disables all type checking and let us assign any type of value value in a variable. Whether is makes sense or not.

It's turn off the type system for a variable and behave like JavaScript. So in that case we are telling TypeScript that, "I don't care what type is this. I know what I'm doing."

### Example:

```tsc
let value: any = "I am a value";
value = 12;
value = true;
value = {"value1", "value2"}
value = ["value1", "value2"]
```

### When to use:

We can use it when need the output quickly and at the time of prototyping. But it should be remember the refactor of code.

## unknown

### What it means:

unknown is a type-safe version of any. We can assign anything to it, but we can't use it directly without checking the type.

### Example:

```tsc
let text: unknown = "Hello";

if(typeof text === 'string'){
console.log(text.toUpperCase());
}
```

### When to use:

It can be used when we are receiving dynamic data and enforce validation or type checking before using it. unknown encourages us safer programming by narrowing the type before using it.

## never

### What it means

never represents a value that should never happen or exist. This is used where a function never return any value.

### Example:

```tsc
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message); // Never returns
}

function infiniteLoop(): never {
  while (true) {}
}
```

### When to use

We can use never in function that never return (like infinite loop or errors).
